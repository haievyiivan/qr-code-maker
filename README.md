# qr-code-maker

A simple Python script to generate QR codes from a URL.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* `qrcode` library (with Pillow support for image generation)

## Installation

Install the required dependency using pip:

```bash
pip install "qrcode[pil]"
```

## Usage

1. **Configure the URL**: Open main.py. The script currently generates a QR code for my website by default. You can change the url variable to your desired link.

2. **Run the script**:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. **Output**: The generated QR code will be saved in the same directory as qrcode.png.

## Sample Output

Here is an example of a QR code generated by this script:

![Sample QR Code](samples/qrcode.png)

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Command Line Arguments**: Update the script to accept the URL and output folder directly (e.g., python main.py <url> <path> --someArgs).
- [ ] **Smart File Naming**: Stop the script from overwriting your old images by naming them automatically based on the URL (and style settings).
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add checks to ensure the URL is valid so the script doesn't crash on bad input.
- [ ] **Global Shortcut**: Package the app so you can run it from anywhere on your computer using a simple command like qr-code-maker.
- [ ] **Custom Settings**: Add options to change colors and size without editing the code (e.g., -blue -large).
